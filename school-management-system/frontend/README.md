# School Management System Frontend

This is the frontend part of the School Management System project. It is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. The frontend interacts with the backend API built with FastAPI to manage school-related data.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that includes the layout for the application.
- **css/styles.css**: Contains styles for the application, including layout, responsiveness, and design elements.
- **js/app.js**: JavaScript code that handles CRUD operations, manages filters, sorting, and localStorage for persistence, and includes form validations.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for managing students and classes.
- Search functionality to quickly find records.
- Filters and statistics sections for better data management.
- Responsive design for accessibility on various devices.

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application.
